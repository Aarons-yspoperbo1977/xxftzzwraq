Okay, so just finished Bring Her Back, and I'm like... what the heck did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? 😂 I mean, I legit can't tell if the plot twist was mind-blowing or just mind-numbing. Like, they really played us halfway through with that twist about the dude who wasn't who he seemed. You know the one I'm talking about. I nearly spilled my drink!

And the pacing, oh man, it was all over the place. One minute I'm hooked, next I'm like 'did I just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   wrong or is this part meant to be slo-mo?' Seriously though, the cinematography was kinda dope. Props to whoever was behind that because I bet trying to make sense of that script wasn’t easy.

> Gotta say, the soundtrack was on point though. Some of the tracks really hit deep, made me feel things and stuff, you know? Like, kudos to whoever curated that playlist. I need a playlist like that just for my life. Haha, ever felt like you're in a   scene waiting for your perfect soundtrack?

And don't get me started on the lead actress. Absolute QUEEN. She carried the whole thing like a pro. But the supporting cast... eh, a mixed bag. Some of 'em were straight-up cardboard cutouts. 😂 Like, did they just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and forget they had jobs to do?

Also, can we talk about that ending? I was kinda expecting something a bit more satisfying? Or maybe I'm just too used to MCU-type closure, you know? Anyway, I think I’ll need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again just to feel alright about the bits I probably slept through the first time. Or maybe just read a synopsis on Wikipedia. 😂

randomC#code = Console.WriteLine('Why is this here?');

Anyway, I think they’re setting it up for a sequel? Not sure if I’m ready for round two though. Might need a break from all that drama before diving back in. Who even knows with these things? 🤷‍♀️
